ZebraZoom can be used to track the head and tail of freely swimming and of head-embedded larval and adult zebrafish. It can also be used to track the center of mass of other animal species, such as mice or drosophila. The software operates through an intuitive graphical user interface, making it very simple to use for people with no programming background.

The Graphical user interface of ZebraZoom also offers options to launch the tracking on multiple videos all at once and to cluster bouts of movements into distinct behaviors with unsupervised machine learning. A troubleshooting option is also intergrated inside the graphical user interface.
