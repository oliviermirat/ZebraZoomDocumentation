# Configuration file creation through the GUI

In order to track videos other than the ones provided on ZebraZoom's website, you might need to create your own configuration files. In order to do that, you can click on “Prepare configuration file for tracking” and follow the steps described to create a configuration file adapted to the videos you want to track. Please note that this procedure isn't complete and may not work on all videos. If you don't manage to create a configuration file on your own, you can contact us at info@zebrazoom.org and we will try to make one for you.

Tip: once you've created a configuration file for some videos and launched the tracking on those videos using that configuration file, check the quality of the tracking and bouts extraction by clicking on “Visualize ZebraZoom's output”. If you are unsatisfied with the results, you can refine the configuration file you created by clicking on “Prepare configuration file for tracking” in the main menu and then by clicking on the box “Click here to start from a configuration file previously created (instead of from scratch)”: this will allow you to reload and refine the configuration file you already created. You can then save that refined configuration file and use it to re-tracked your videos.
