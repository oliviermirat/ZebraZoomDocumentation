# Troubleshooting tracking issues

If you are having trouble tracking animals in a video, you can click on the button "Troubleshoot" in the main menu to create a smaller sub-video out of the video you are trying to track. Once this sub-video is created, you can send it to info@zebrazoom.org and we can try to help.
